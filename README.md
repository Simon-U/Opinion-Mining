# Opinion mining from hotel reviews

In the following notebook the TripAdvisor dataset with hotel reviews will be analysed.
The idea is to mine the opinion of the hotel stay from customer reviews. 
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used to cluster the reviews in topics and afterwards Rapid Keyword Extraction to
provide more meaningful names for the clusters.

1. Preprocess the dataset
2. Find optimal model
3. Visualization
4. Build Dash web app

The relevant files is LDA.ipynb notebook and the corresponding modules.Â
